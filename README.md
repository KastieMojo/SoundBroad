# SoundBroad Discord Bot

This isn't meant to be portable or a plug-and-play bot. It’s just my personal, locally hosted Discord bot for soundboard and YouTube audio fun.

If you’re here because you *actually* want to use it, here’s how:

1. Clone the repo.  
2. Create a `.env` file with your bot token, your Discord user ID (for creator commands), and your server (guild) IDs.  
3. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  
4. Run the bot locally with `python bot.py`.  
5. Customize your sounds in the `/sounds` folder.  
6. Invite the bot to your server(s) and enjoy!

No promises this will work perfectly for you — it’s mostly a project I built for my own amusement. But if you want to tweak it or learn from it, by all means!
